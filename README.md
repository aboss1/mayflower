# mayflower


##Final Problem Statement
Existing support structures disappear when people move and they want to know how they can build them back up again.

##Summary
In order to offer a unique social experience for people who are planning to move, Mayflower will enable users to connect with others who are moving to the same city during the same season. Users will have access to a dashboard that will show where people in their “class” are going to be living in the city. In addition, users can poll their class to aggregate answers for questions like, “Which moving company are you using?”, “I heard Bakery X is a great place to chat with locals. Have you all heard the same thing?”, etc.  In addition, recommended activities will show up in their dashboard once they move to their new location and users can plan and create events to connect with other members of their class. The aggregation of data and creation of events is just one aspect of the product. Users will be able to create their own profiles and enter a variety of information ranging from basic information to noise tolerance to hobbies. This will enable users to find those who are most similar to them and potential roommates. Mayflower will be linked to Facebook so users can also see if they have mutual friends with members in their class and users’ friends can “endorse” them on Facebook. For those who are not moving to a metropolitan area, classes will be aggregated by general areas such as “rural New York.”

##Benefit
Mayflower directly benefits users by creating a commonly known type of social group (a “class”) in an accessible environment. Users will be able to not only find roommates, but potential friends. The support structure is strengthened by polls and a variety of user created events. By offering roommate endorsements, Mayflower benefits the user by providing a one stop support structure service. 

##Target Population
Our target population consists of adults (in addition to retired adults) who are planning on making a move to a metropolitan area. Our target population is primarily focused on adults who are moving by themselves, although Mayflower is applicable for young families looking to connect with others in similar situations.
